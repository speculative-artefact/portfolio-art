	<meta name="description" content="Bradley Walker is an Amsterdam-based artist working with speculative virtual worlds and interactive installations. In his practice he explores virtual representations, recreations, and rememberings of spaces, objects, and moments. Reimagining anthropocentric worlds and anxiety as murky, digitised archives for a future without us." />
