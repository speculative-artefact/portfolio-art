# Bradley Walker - Artist Portfolio

This is the source code for the portfolio website of Bradley Walker, an Amsterdam-based artist. The live website can be found at [https://bradleywalker.net](https://bradleywalker.net).

The site is built using [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/).

## Developing

Once you've cloned the project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy the app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment (e.g., Vercel, Netlify).
